=======================+

A fast logging library. Format strings get saved at program init, and logging
lines are turned into a unique identifier and the accompanying data. Logging
output is written as binary data to stdout rather than printed in the
traditional printf() manner. To read logging output, the data must first be
converted from LOL format into human readable text.

TODO:
[_] data format for saved logging lines
[_] converter for LOL'd output using save format plus logging data
[_] library frontend that saves logging lines
[_] library frontend that spits out logging data in a binary format
[_] support for pointers?
